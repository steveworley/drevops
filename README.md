## Understanding DrevOps
DrevOps is a Drupal project scaffolding template with included development
environment, CI configuration and tools. It can be used on new or existing
projects as is or can be customized as required. It may also be used as a
reference for custom configurations.

DrevOps is designed to support updating of the code templates it provides.
This makes it easy to keep projects using DrevOps up-to-date with the latest
scaffolding code.

DrevOps supports both database-driven development and fresh install for every
build. Database-driven development is when the existing production database is
used for every build (useful for product development), while fresh install is
when the site is installed from the scratch during every build (useful for
module or profile development).

DrevOps has own automated tests that guarantees stability and ease of maintenance.

**<summary>Expand for more non-technical information</summary>**

### What is the problem that DrevOps is trying to solve?
Increase the quality of the produced Drupal websites with minimum setup effort and knowledge.

### Why is this problem important?
High quality Drupal websites are stable, secure, faster and safer to change.

But developers do not always have the time or skills to setup the tools required
to produce and maintain high-quality Drupal websites.

### How does DrevOps solve it?
Quick install of best practices Drupal configuration on Docker stack using a
single command lowers entry barrier, while unification of the developer's
experience improves development speed across projects.

### Who is it for?
- Digital agencies that want to standardise their development stack (standard
  operating environment) across projects
- Developers that are looking for best practices
- Developers that do not possess required time or knowledge to setup these tools
  themselves

### How does it work?
- You run installer script once
- DrevOps brings the latest release into your codebase
- You commit all new files
- If required, you may override files with changes relevant only to a specific
  project.

### What if I don't like the defaults this project provides?
Since DrevOps is a template, it can be forked and adjusted to your needs. The
installer script will continue to work with your fork, provided that you adjust
several environment variables.

**In other words - you will have your own development templates for your own
projects  the way you want it!**

## Why is DrevOps awesome?
- **Highly configurable**  <br/>
  All configuration is made through environment variables without the need to change any of the scripts.
- **Flexible**<br/>
  Anything can be overridden for your specific project and will not be lost during the next update.
- **Pure Docker stack**  <br/>
  No special binaries to work with Docker. No generated Docker Compose configurations from custom configurations. Modify configuration to fit your project needs.
- **Tested**  <br/>
  There are tests for workflows, configuration, deployments, CI. Everything. And they run automatically on every commit.
- **Versioned**  <br/>
  It is always clear which version of the stack your site uses.
- **Upgradable**  <br/>
  Your website can be updated to a newer version of DrevOps with minimal effort. Your project customisations are easily preserved.
- **Documented**  <br/>
  The major areas of DrevOps are explicitly documented, while most of the code is self-documented.

## What areas does DrevOps cover?
- Drupal
- Local development environment
- Code linting
- Testing
- Automated builds (CI)
- Deployment
- Documentation
- Integrations
- Maintenance

## Contributing
- Progress is tracked as [GitHub project](https://github.com/drevops/drevops/projects/1).
- Development takes place in 2 independent branches named after Drupal core version: `7.x` or `8.x`.
- Create an issue and prefix title with Drupal core version: `[8.x] Updated readme file.`.
- Create PRs with branches prefixed with Drupal core version: `7.x` or `8.x`. For example, `feature/8.x-updated-readme`.

### Main concepts behind DrevOps
- **Fetch as much of development configuration as possible from DrevOps repository**<br/>
  Allows to keep your project up-to-date with DrevOps
- **Avoid adding things to the wrong places**<br/>
  Example: Using Composer scripts for workflow commands. Instead, use tools specifically designed for this, like Ahoy
- **Abstract similar functionality into steps**<br/>
  Allows to apply changes at the larger scale without the need to modify each project
- **Run the most of the code in the containers**<br/>
  Reduces the number of required tools on the host machine

## Onboarding
Use [Onboarding checklist](ONBOARDING.md) to track the project onboarding progress.

## Local environment setup
- Make sure that you have latest versions of all required software installed:
  - [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
  - [Pygmy](https://pygmy.readthedocs.io/)
  - [Ahoy](https://github.com/ahoy-cli/ahoy)
- Make sure that all local web development services are shut down (Apache/Nginx, Mysql, MAMP etc).
- Checkout project repository (in one of the [supported Docker directories](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/osxfs/#access-control)).

[//]: # (#;< ACQUIA)

- Authenticate with Acquia Cloud API
  1. Create your Acquia Cloud API token:<br/>
     Acquia Cloud UI -> Account -> API tokens -> Create Token
  2. Copy `default.env.local` to `.env.local`.
  3. Populate `$AC_API_KEY` and `$AC_API_SECRET` environment variables in
     `.env.local` file with values generated in the step above.

[//]: # (#;> ACQUIA)

[//]: # (#;< LAGOON)

- Authenticate with Lagoon
  1. Create an SSH key and add it to your account in the [Lagoon Dashboard](https://ui-lagoon-master.ch.amazee.io/).
  2. Copy `default.env.local` to `.env.local`.
  3. Update `$LAGOON_SSH_KEY_FILE` environment variable in `.env.local` file
  with the path to the SSH key.

[//]: # (#;> LAGOON)


[//]: # (#;< !FRESH_INSTALL)

- `ahoy download-db`

[//]: # (#;> !FRESH_INSTALL)
- `pygmy up`
- `ahoy build`

### Apple M1 adjustments

The AIO supported version of Pygmy does not appear to receive updates any longer,
appears pygmy-go is the de-facto standard going forward. There is not a stable
release with Apple Silicon support yet, however the following dev branch is
entirely functional, so we need to build from sources.

```
pygmy down && pygmy-go down
git clone --branch arm_testing git@github.com:tobybellwood/pygmy-go.git ./pygmy-go-dev
cd ./pygmy-go-dev
make build
cd builds
cp pygmy-go-darwin-arm64 $(which pygmy)
pygmy version # should output 'Pygmy version unidentifiable.'
pygmy up
```

Copy `default.docker-compose.override.yml` to `docker-compose.override.yml`.
